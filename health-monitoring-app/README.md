* Later on more than one relative might be added for monitoring
* The might be relative(s) could be added by someone with adequate permissions
* Report schedule might be configurable independently for each observer
* Other mediums to display a report might be added later on
* Doctor might have grid view or list view of patients
* The setup might be extended to multiple doctors for a hospital
* Types of stakeholders(users) might increase e.g hospital, nurse, home caretaker etc.
